## Stage 1: Foundation Building
#### 1. Python Programming
- Goal: Gain proficiency in Python, the primary language for machine learning, data processing, and automation.
- Resources:
    - Codecademy or freeCodeCamp: Beginner Python courses.
    - Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes (book or online resources).
- Practice: Write simple Python scripts (e.g., data processing, file handling).
#### 2. Data Handling and Storage
- SQL: Strengthen your SQL skills since you'll work with structured data.
    - Kaggle’s SQL courses: Free, with datasets to practice.
    - SQLBolt: Interactive exercises.
- NoSQL (MongoDB):
    - MongoDB University: Free MongoDB basics course.
#### 3. Basics of APIs and Web Scraping (Python Focused)
- Goal: Develop skills in REST APIs and web scraping, which can help in IPA scenarios where data extraction from web sources is required.
- Resources:
    - Real Python: API development and web scraping tutorials.
    - Libraries: Flask for APIs, Requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping.
- Practice: Build a simple API in Flask and scrape a webpage to gather structured data.
## Stage 2: Core AI and Machine Learning
#### 1. Machine Learning Fundamentals
- Goal: Learn the basics of machine learning, focusing on concepts useful for IPA like classification, regression, and clustering.
- Resources:
    - Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Course on Coursera (auditable for free).
    - Google’s Machine Learning Crash Course.
    - Scikit-Learn for practical, hands-on projects.
- Practice: Build simple classifiers (e.g., email spam classifier).
#### 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Goal: Gain skills in NLP for tasks like document classification and text extraction.
- Resources:
    - Natural Language Processing with Python (book by O'Reilly).
    - Libraries: NLTK for foundational NLP, spaCy for production-grade NLP.
- Practice: Classify document text into categories (e.g., emails into topics).
#### 3. Computer Vision (Optional, if needed for Document Automation)
- Goal: Understand basics of image processing, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- Resources:
    - OpenCV tutorials (free documentation online).
    - Tesseract OCR (open-source).
- Practice: Implement OCR on simple scanned documents to extract text.
## Stage 3: Intelligent Process Automation Tools and Frameworks
#### 1. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Basics
- Goal: Familiarize yourself with RPA concepts and tools.
- Resources:
    - UiPath Community Edition: Free for practice.
    - Robocorp (open-source RPA) tutorials.
- Practice: Automate a simple desktop or web task, like logging into a site and extracting data.
#### 2. Document Processing and Extraction
- Goal: Build skills in processing documents and extracting structured information.
- Resources:
    - Tesseract OCR for text extraction.
    - Pandas library for data manipulation.
- Practice: Use Tesseract to extract text and Pandas to organize it into a table.
#### 3. Automation with APIs and Orchestration
- Goal: Integrate various parts of IPA into a cohesive automation flow.
- Resources:
    - Flask or FastAPI: Use for creating REST APIs.
    - Docker: Set up your environment in containers.
- Practice: Create an API that receives documents, classifies them, and returns structured data.
## Stage 4: Advanced Skills and Deployment
#### 1. Deep Learning (Optional but Useful for Complex IPA Systems)
- Goal: Understand deep learning for more complex text and image processing tasks.
- Resources:
    - TensorFlow or PyTorch basics (both have free documentation and tutorials).
- Practice: Build a simple neural network for document classification.
#### 2. Containerization and Orchestration
- Goal: Use Docker and Docker Compose to deploy IPA components in containers.
- Resources:
    - Docker documentation and Docker’s Getting Started Guide.
- Practice: Containerize a Flask API and a MongoDB instance.
#### 3. CI/CD and Version Control
- Goal: Learn to manage and deploy your IPA solution.
- Resources:
    - GitHub or GitLab: Set up version control and CI/CD.
- Practice: Automate deployment of your Dockerized application to a server.
## Stage 5: Project Integration – Building Your Own IPA
1. Define a Process to Automate: Select a multi-step, real-world process, such as handling customer inquiries.
2. Design the Workflow: Outline the steps for classification, indexing, and extraction.
3. Build, Test, and Deploy: Put your knowledge together, implementing the IPA, testing it, and deploying it using Docker.
4. Iterate and Improve: Refine your solution based on feedback or additional features.
